Clean up comments in $ARGUMENTS: remove obvious comments that restate the code, delete commented blocks, convert valuable explanations of WHY something works or edge-case warnings into proper JSDoc with params/returns/examples.

**$ARGUMENTS:** File path or glob pattern (e.g., `src/utils/formatters.ts`, `src/components/**/*.vue`)

Reference **typescript-conventions** for JSDoc patterns.
