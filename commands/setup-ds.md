Create a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file for this design system package that will help future Claude sessions understand how to leverage it effectively.

Include:
1. **Component inventory** - List all available components with their props and use cases
2. **Design tokens** - Colors, spacing, typography, breakpoints, and how to access them
3. **Common patterns** - Typical component combinations and layouts we use
4. **Usage examples** - Code snippets showing proper implementation
5. **Import paths** - How to import components and utilities
6. **Styling approach** - Our methodology (CSS modules, styled-components, utility classes, etc.)
7. **Component variants** - Different sizes, states, and style options available
8. **When NOT to use** - Cases where custom implementation is appropriate

Focus on practical information that will help identify replacement opportunities and proper usage patterns.
