Analyze staged changes and identify domains affected (Vue components, TypeScript, CSS, API layer, Nx config).

Review against project-philosophy and relevant convention skills. Apply "fool-proof > bullet-proof" — flag only issues that solve actual problems, not theoretical improvements.

Check for:

- Consistency with existing patterns
- Performance implications
- Potential bugs
- YAGNI violations

Prepare a numbered list of specific, actionable recommendations. Each should reference specific code and propose the simplest fix.

Omit: style nitpicks covered by linters, "consider adding" suggestions, future-proofing.
